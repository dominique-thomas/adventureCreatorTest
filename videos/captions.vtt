Welcome to the walkthrough guide for the Pre-Dinner Prep Simulation.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In this video, we'll show you how to complete the simulation step-by-step.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
When you start the simulation, you'll be asked to enter your name. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Hover your mouse over the text input box until you see the text cursor. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Press the Delete key to clear the textbox, then type your name. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Click the OK button to confirm.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
After entering your name, you'll see the BASIC CONTROLS screen. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This screen provides an overview of how to move around and interact with the environment. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Click the CLOSE button to close the menu. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If you ever need to see this menu again, simply press the Escape key and then click the CONTROLS menu option.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
As the simulation starts, your character mentions that friends are coming over, and there's a to-do list on the fridge. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Navigate to the fridge and click the to-do list. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You can complete the tasks in any order, but we'll follow the sequential order shown on the list. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Click the CLOSE button when you're done reviewing the tasks. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If you forget what to do, you can always view the list again at any time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
To clean up the trash, first walk to the sink. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Click the cabinet to open it and then click on the trash bag. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Pick up all the trash in the living room and the bedroom. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The order doesn't matter. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
When you're done, go to the garage. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000

To fix the TV, walk to the TV in the living room and click on the TV.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
To assemble the dining table, walk to the garage and pick up a cross-tip screwdriver from the tool board. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Next, click the dining table box on the floor.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Pick up the box of screws, surface plates, and table legs to add them to your inventory.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Review the instruction manual for assembly instructions. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Click the CLOSE button to close the manual. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You can review the manual anytime if you need help.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Next, click the table and select the surface plates, then click the table to place them. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Click the table again and select the screws from your inventory, then click the table to place them. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Click the table once more and select the cross-tip screwdriver, then click the table to tighten the screws. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Finally, click the table and select the table legs, then click the table to screw the legs in place.

Click the door and select the "Welcome my guests" option. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You'll be taken to a summary screen that explains the actions you've performed.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I hope you enjoy playing and exploring the environment. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Feel free to interact with other objects and discover more about the simulation!
